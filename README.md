GitHub Issue Viewer

Use this app to view issues within a GitHub Repo

Things to note:

-App built on Railway (this saved loads of time, of course)
-Oktokit gem for accessing the GitHub API
-Basic validation and error handling for unexpected values, invalid repos, etc
-Some pretty mediocre styling
-Truncating issue body for the sake of aesthetics/cleanliness, with indication that full issue is available by clicking
-Clicking an issue in the app will bring you directly to that issue in GitHub
-Proper abstraction of env variable
-Link back home from issues page
-Links to my profile and repo
