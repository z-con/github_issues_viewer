<h1>IssueList.app</h1>

<h2>GitHub Issue Viewer</h2>

Use this app to view issues within a GitHub Repo

Things to note:

-App built on Railway (this saved loads of time, of course) <br>
-Oktokit gem for accessing the GitHub API <br>
-Basic validation and error handling for unexpected values, invalid repos, etc <br>
-Some pretty mediocre styling <br>
-Truncating issue body for the sake of aesthetics/cleanliness, with indication that full issue is available by clicking <br>
-Clicking an issue in the app will bring you directly to that issue in GitHub <br>
-Proper abstraction of env variable <br>
-Link back home from issues page <br>
-Links to my profile and repo <br>
-App lives at domain issuelist.app
